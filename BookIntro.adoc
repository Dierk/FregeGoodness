== Welcome to Frege Goodness

The purpose of this book is to assemble a series of
_posts_ or _chapters_ that are both reasonably quick to
write and to read.

The gitbook system is an ideal place for this purpose.
You, the reader, get instant updates as soon as there is new
content available but unlike a blog, you also have the full
series in your hand.

The Frege Goodness format is inspired by @MrHaki, who runs his
Groovy-/Grails-/Gradle-
Goodness series since a long time. I follow his example for the
topic of the Frege programming language.

=== For the advanced beginner

The chapters currently do _not_ cover the very first steps into
Frege, how to download, install, set up the compiler, and run
programs. Also basic syntax is not explained. There are many
excellent Haskell books that do that job.

I assume that you have some experience in programming, most
likely in Java.

My goal is to share information that inspires an _advanced beginner_
to explore each topic even further.
